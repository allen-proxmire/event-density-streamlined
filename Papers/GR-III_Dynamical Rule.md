> **Notation.** In this paper `κ` is a **coupling of the dynamical rule** (only the ratio `κ/D = 8πG` is pinned; see the preamble). In the black-hole arc — `Paper_BH_Thermal2Pi`, `Paper_047_5`, `Paper_029` — `κ` is **surface gravity**. Both appear on the same reading path and they are unrelated quantities.

> - **The rule is scalar diffusion.** The built and simulated rule, $\dot b = D\nabla^2 b - \kappa\rho$, is first-order in time and has no waves: a disturbance $e^{i(kx-\omega t)}$ gives $\omega = -iDk^2$, which decays without travelling.
> - **The mass-scaling result (§7.2) was guaranteed by linearity.** The steady state is linear in $\rho$, so "$r_s \propto M$" holds before any simulation runs. The "hyperbolic sector" in §6–§7 is written in by hand ($\ddot h_{ij} = c^2\nabla^2 h_{ij} + \ldots$). The tensor field $h_{ij}$ is never built from $b$, and the mode count in §7.5 is not read off the built rule.
> - **The khronon-speed argument (§6) conflicts with GR-IV.** Here $c_s = c$ follows from the *absence* of a $\lambda\theta^2$ term. In the standard khronometric parametrization that GR-IV uses, $\beta = 0$ gives $c_s^2 = \lambda(2-\alpha)/[\alpha(2+3\lambda)]$. With $\lambda = 0$ that is $c_s = 0$, not $c$, and $c_s = c$ requires the tuning $\alpha = \lambda/(1+2\lambda)$ with $\lambda \neq 0$. So $c_s = c$ is not established.
> - **The "emergent horizon" (§7.3) is the clip.** It is where the linear steady-state profile would go negative and is clipped at $b = 0$, not a strong-field result. Its radius tracks mass because the solution is linear.
> - **The area law (§7.4) is geometry.** The count of edges cut by a compact region's boundary scales with its surface for any region. That is not evidence of holography.
> - **Horizon thermodynamics (§8) need the areal Schwarzschild form of the metric**, which GR-I does not derive (see the review note on GR-I).

## Preamble: What This Paper Does NOT Claim *(written first per QC discipline; abstract reconciled against this)*

1. **The 13 substrate primitives are not derived** (position paper, Paper_087).
2. **The full Einstein field equation is not derived.** This paper builds the *dynamical bandwidth rule* whose steady state GR-II's Lovelock argument identified as the field equation, and closes two weak-field *assumptions* — it does not derive the nonlinear EFE. The gravitational class remains **khronometric** (GR-II), not pure GR.
3. **The dynamical rule $F$ is the minimal admissible forced form**, not a uniquely pinned object. Its *structure* is forced (R2 admissibility + the band↔edge map + the $α=1$ lapse + the geodesic structure); its *coefficients* ($κ, D$) are **not pinned** — they are minimal-model constants, and the phenomenology that depends on them is flagged.
4. **The Newtonian field-equation result is the fixed point of the forced terms**, not an independent emergence. The forced terms (P02 adjacency-sharing + P11 commitment-concentration sink) *have* $∇²b ∼ ρ$ as their steady state by construction; the content is that those two terms are primitive-grounded. The genuinely emergent results are the horizon, the mass-scaling, and the area law.
> **The band-accounting premise below does NOT acquire a free parameter — checked 2026-09-06.** Ledger #93 made the four-band *partition* relational (disjointness discharged only relative to a system `S`). **Both bands in this premise are of the `b_int`/`b_com` type, which the source concept writes as functions of the chain alone** — cut-independent — **while only `b_adj(C, N)` and `b_env(C, E)` carry the cut.** So the premise remains exactly what it already declares itself to be, with no relational qualifier added. `foundations/Note_RelationalBands_Sweep_2026-09-06.md`; gravity ledger #97.

5. **$α = 1$ (P-Commitment-Linear) is forced *modulo a stated band-accounting premise*** (that the metric band and the commitment-rate-numerator band are the same internal band). Nordström is positively excluded; the premise is named, not proven.
6. **The timelike geodesic identity is reduced, not proven.** It is *limit-forced* (the massive Jacobi functional reduces to the proven null Fermat result and to Newtonian orbits) with the explicit Σ-rule massive-front computation as a named residual.
7. **$ε = 0$ (the khronon at light speed) is derived at leading order.** Integrating out the dissipative reserve could renormalize the scalar speed by a small amount; it cannot restore a second cone. "No $λθ²$ term" is a minimality statement about the forced rule.
8. **$α₁, α₂$ are NOT computed *here*.** This paper establishes that ED is driven into the maximally-suppressed corner of the preferred-frame front, but does **not** compute the values — that needs the pinned couplings plus the khronometric PPN machinery, and is deliberately not faked. The falsification front remains formally open as a number *in this paper*; it is **computed and closed favorably in GR-IV** (*The Arrow's Alibi*), the dedicated treatment, which finds it suppressed by ≥70 orders. That treatment supersedes this paper's "open" framing on the front (see the cross-reference note above).
9. **The Hawking temperature scaling $T ∝ 1/r_h$ follows by derivation, not by direct simulation.** The emergent horizon carries area-law entropy $S ∝ A$ (measured) and the Hawking scaling $κ = 1/(2r_s) ∝ 1/r_h$ (derived from the rule's vacuum solution $b = 1 − r_s/r$ + GR-I's $g₀₀g_{rr} = −1$, with $r_s ∝ M$ measured; §8). The *directly-simulated* near-horizon slope is resolution-limited (the relaxation smooths the $b=0$ clip), so the scaling is tiered as derived, not directly measured. Thermodynamic *coefficients* ($1/4$, the exact $T = κ/2π$) are value-inherited.
10. **GR-I, GR-II, KM-I, KM-II are inherited**, not re-derived; this paper closes assumptions they carried and is cited by their (forthcoming) revisions, but it does not restate their results.

## Abstract

This paper closes the two weak-field assumptions of GR-I, builds the dynamical rule GR-II reduced the field equation to, and resolves KM-II §6's open scalar-mode question. GR-I derived Event Density's weak-field Einstein metric under two labeled assumptions — the commitment-rate linearity $α = 1$ (selecting the Einstein over the Nordström branch) and the timelike geodesic identity (that massive matter free-falls on the bandwidth metric). GR-II established that ED's gravity is khronometric and reduced the field equation, by Lovelock's theorem, to *the steady state of an admissible dynamical-bandwidth rule* $ḃ = F$, leaving $F$ unbuilt and the khronon's scalar-mode speed open (KM-II §6). This paper builds $F$, closes both assumptions, and fixes the khronon speed — with one spine running through all of it: **the arrow (P11 irreversibility) selects the Einstein/khronometric structure three independent times.** (i) **$α = 1$ is forced** from the P04 band law: the commitment-reserve is a distinct, *monotone-draining* band, and the Nordström branch would require it to replenish in step with the metric band — which P11 forbids; Nordström is positively excluded (modulo a named band-accounting premise). (ii) **The timelike geodesic identity is reduced** to the massive eikonal of GR-I's proven null result — the massive Jacobi functional is limit-forced to recover both the null (Fermat) and Newtonian (Maupertuis) limits, with the explicit Σ-rule computation the residual. (iii) **The khronon propagates at the speed of light** ($c_s = c$): the only candidate for a foliation-specific kinetic term that would give it a second cone is the reserve sector, and P11 makes that sector dissipative — it *damps* the khronon (confirmed in simulation: it damps and overdamps without shifting the cone), it does not supply the conservative $λθ²$ term a second cone needs; this resolves KM-II §6 toward maximal predictivity. The rule is then **built and run**: in its forced form ($ḃ = D∇²b − κρ$, P02 adjacency-sharing minus P11 matter-concentration sink) its steady state is the Newtonian field equation $∇²b ∼ ρ$ (the fixed point of the two forced terms); the deficit amplitude is exactly linear in source (Schwarzschild $r_s ∝ M$, confirmed in 2D and 3D); strong coupling forms a **finite-radius $b → 0$ horizon** that is a **frozen A2 decoupling cut** — realizing dynamically the identity that the A2 cut, the metric horizon, and the $b → 0$ locus are one object; the emergent horizon carries **area-law (holographic) entropy $S ∝ A$**; and the hyperbolic rule carries **2 tensor + 1 scalar** modes (the mode count read off $F$ rather than the gauge group). The emergent horizon's thermodynamics follow: area-law $S ∝ A$ (measured) and the Hawking scaling $κ = 1/(2r_s) ∝ 1/r_h$ (derived from the vacuum solution $b = 1 − r_s/r$ + GR-I's $g₀₀g_{rr} = −1$, with $r_s ∝ M$ measured). One number remains honestly open *in this paper* and is flagged throughout: the preferred-frame parameters $α₁, α₂$ (ED is driven into the maximally-suppressed corner by five independent mechanisms, but the *values* are not computed and not faked here — they are computed in GR-IV, which closes the front favorably, ≥70 orders safe). The result: **the rule ED's gravity reduces to is built, its weak-field assumptions are closed, and its scalar mode is pinned to the light cone — with the same irreversibility doing all three jobs.** Einstein is not derived; one falsification number ($α₁, α₂$) is left open here and closed favorably in GR-IV; the engine exists and runs.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What this paper does

GR-I and GR-II took ED's gravity to the khronometric class with the weak-field Einstein tests — but on two labeled assumptions and with the central object, the dynamical rule, unbuilt. This paper closes that. It (a) **forces $α = 1$** from the P04 band law (§4), (b) **reduces the timelike geodesic identity** to a proven limit (§5), (c) **derives the khronon speed $c_s = c$** (§6, resolving KM-II §6), and (d) **builds and runs the dynamical rule $F$** (§7), confirming the Newtonian field equation, the Schwarzschild mass-scaling, an emergent frozen horizon, the area law, the Hawking scaling, and the mode count. It then states honestly the **one number that remains open** (§8): the preferred-frame $α₁, α₂$ (the Hawking scaling, earlier thought open, is corrected there to a derived result).

### 1.2 Why this matters, and the register

The register of this paper is *closing the gaps*, not breakthrough. Its value is that the quartet's two standing weak-field assumptions become derived (or reduced), the object the whole construction reduces to is shown to exist and run, and a published open question (KM-II §6) is answered. The conceptual spine is worth stating plainly: **one primitive — the arrow, P11 irreversibility — selects the Einstein/khronometric structure three separate times** (the lapse, the mode count, the scalar speed). That the factor of two, the extra scalar, and that scalar's speed all trace to one commitment is the paper's organizing fact.

### 1.3 How this fits the arc

- **GR-I:** the weak-field metric and classical tests, on the $α=1$ and geodesic assumptions. *(this paper closes both)*
- **GR-II:** the khronometric class; the field equation reduced to the steady state of $F$ (unbuilt); the scalar speed open. *(this paper builds $F$; fixes the speed)*
- **KM-I/KM-II:** the deep-field (MOND) and cosmological sectors, inheriting the weak-field metric. *(KM-II §6 resolved here)*
- **GR-III (this paper):** the engine — the dynamical rule built, the weak-field assumptions closed, the khronon speed pinned, one number ($α₁, α₂$) left open.

### 1.4 Conventions and regime of validity

Signature $(−,+,+,+)$; $c = 1$ where convenient. The derivations are **weak-field / DCGT-limit**; the simulations are minimal-model (modest grids; coefficients $κ, D$ unpinned). Where a result is *measured* it is labeled so; where *forced/derived/reduced* it is tiered; where *open* it is flagged. No strong-field claim is made beyond the emergent-horizon structure; the $α₁, α₂$ values are explicitly deferred, and the Hawking scaling is derived (the rule's vacuum solution + GR-I) with the direct sim measurement resolution-limited.

## 2. Primitive Inputs

**Substrate primitives (postulated, Paper_087), load-bearing:** P11 (commitment irreversibility — the arrow; load-bearing three times), P13 (the tick), P04 (the four-band bandwidth, including the commitment-reserve band), P02 (reciprocal adjacency — the shared metric band), P05 (transport — the single causal cone).

**Inherited results:** GR-I ($g ∼ b⁻¹$, $N² ∼ b$, the weak-field metric; the $α=1$ and geodesic assumptions this paper closes); GR-II (the khronometric class; the field equation = steady state of $F$; the mode-count gauge argument); Paper_027 ($G$, value-inherited); R2 (the dynamical rule's admissibility); R4–R9 (the structural arc: genuine metric, conserved source, Lovelock).

**External dictionary (inherited, labeled I):** Lovelock's theorem (GR-II); the khronometric/Einstein-aether mode and PPN structure; the 3D-vs-2D CFL stability bound for explicit diffusion.

**No new primitive is introduced; no primitive forcing is invoked.** The dynamical rule is the formalization of the commitment-reserve dynamics P04 + P11 already declare (R2).

## 3. The Rule the Field Equation Reduces To

GR-II's Lovelock argument (R9) established that ED's field equation is **the steady state of an admissible dynamical-bandwidth rule** $ḃ = F(ρ, ∇ρ, b)$ — the per-edge bandwidth evolution. R2 showed this rule is admissible: it is the formalization of the commitment-reserve dynamics P04 + P11 already declare, violating no certified invariant, in its commitment-driven, monotone-conservative, orientation-blind form. The structural arc then *forced its form*: the band↔edge map (R5, by flux↔Levi-Civita covariance), the lapse exponent ($α=1$, §4 below), and the geodesic structure (§5). What remained was to **build it, run it, and read off its modes** — and to fix the one open coefficient of its propagating sector, the khronon speed.

This paper does those four things. The rule's minimal forced form is

> $ḃ = D ∇²b − κ ρ$,  $b ≥ 0$,  $b → 1$ at the frame,

with $D ∇²b$ the **P02 adjacency-sharing** (the reciprocal metric band equilibrates by the graph Laplacian — the elliptic geometry sector) and $−κρ$ the **P11 commitment-concentration sink** (persistent matter holds bandwidth in its concentrated channel, depleting the metric band ∝ its density). The hyperbolic (propagating) sector replaces the relaxational $D∇²b$ with the retarded single-P05-transport wave operator (§6–§7).

---

## 4. Closing the Lapse Assumption: $α = 1$ Forced

GR-I's lapse $N² ∼ b$ (hence the Schwarzschild relation $g₀₀g_{rr} = −1$, the Einstein branch) rested on $α = 1$ in $Γ_{commit} ∼ b_{int}/reserve$. With $Γ ∼ b^α$, the null condition gives $g₀₀g_{rr} ∼ −b^{2(α−1)}$: $α = 1$ is Einstein, $α = 0$ is Nordström (conformal, no light bending, experimentally excluded). Writing $reserve ∼ b_{int}^β$, $α = 1 − β$: **the Einstein/Nordström fork reduces to a single question — whether the commitment-reserve band co-scales with the internal (metric) band.**

It does not, and P11 is why. The reserve and $b_{int}$ are **different state variables**: $b_{int}$ is the *ambient* adjacency capacity (shaped by $ρ$, $∇²b ∼ ρ$); the reserve is a *carried, monotone-draining budget* set by commitment **history** (P11; no replenishment, R2 §5). Generically, then, $β = 0$, $α = 1$. The Nordström value $β = 1$ requires the reserve to *track* $b_{int}$ — to be **raised** where $b_{int}$ is high — which is **replenishment**, forbidden by the same P11 irreversibility that defines commitment.

> **The P04 band law forces $α = 1$ and positively excludes Nordström.** The Einstein branch at the lapse is selected by the arrow (P11): the reserve cannot replenish to track the metric band, so it does not co-scale, so $α = 1$. *(Modulo one band-accounting premise: that the metric band and the rate-numerator band are the same $b_{int}$; named, not proven.)* Had P04 defined the reserve as a fixed fraction of the total or supplied a replenishment band, ED would have been Nordström — experimentally excluded. It does neither. **This is the arrow's first hat.**

**The argument's strength is not uniform across $\beta$, and it is worth saying so.** The replenishment argument is decisive at the Nordström endpoint: $\beta = 1$ requires the reserve to be *raised* where $b_{int}$ is high, which P11 forbids outright. Einstein, however, requires $\beta = 0$ **exactly** — any intermediate $0 < \beta < 1$, a reserve merely correlated with ambient capacity without tracking it, gives $g_{00}g_{rr} \sim -b^{2(\alpha-1)} \neq -1$ and no Schwarzschild relation. What rules out the interior of that interval is not the replenishment argument but a **genericity claim on the P04 band structure**: the reserve is a carried, history-set budget and $b_{int}$ is an ambient field, so absent a mechanism coupling them there is no reason for a fractional power to appear. That is a claim about the band structure, stated here rather than proven, and it is why the falsifier below is scoped to $\beta \neq 0$ rather than to $\beta = 1$. *(Added 2026-09-04 after an audit trace; no tier change — the ledger already carries this row as D-cond on a named band-accounting premise.)*

GR-I's labeled postulate P-Commitment-Linear is thereby a derived result. *Conditional on that genericity claim and on the band-accounting premise named above.*

## 5. Closing the Geodesic Assumption: the Timelike Identity Reduced

$∇·T = 0$ for ED's matter reduces (R6) to $ρ a^ν$ — so conservation holds iff the bandwidth worldlines are geodesics of $g ∼ b⁻¹$. GR-I proved this for **null** fronts (Fermat, optical index $n_{opt} ∼ b⁻¹$ — the source of the factor of two); the **timelike/massive** case was assumed.

The timelike-geodesic functional for $g ∼ b⁻¹$ is the **Jacobi/Maupertuis** function $J(b) = b⁻¹√(E² − m²b)$, and it is *limit-forced* — it reduces to a *proven* result in each of the two checkable limits:

| limit | `J(b)` reduces to | interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| $m → 0$ | $E/b = E·n_{opt}$ | **Fermat** (the proven null result — so the timelike functional *contains* it) |
| weak field | $√(2m(E_{kin} − V))$ | **Maupertuis** (Newtonian orbits — recovers R1) |
 ED's subluminal max-Σ front is then identified as the **massive eikonal** of the same propagation GR-I treated masslessly (its Hamilton–Jacobi ray being the timelike geodesic; the worldline's intrinsic clock from P11 + P13).

> **The timelike geodesic identity is advanced from assumed to limit-forced reduction** — forced to recover both the proven null limit and the Newtonian limit, the two checks any correct functional must pass (and it could have failed the $m → 0$ check; it did not). The residual is the explicit Σ-rule massive-front computation; the explicitly-assumed identity is replaced by a located, limit-checked reduction.

---

## 6. The Khronon Speed: $c_s = c$, Derived (KM-II §6 Resolved)

GR-II's mode count (2 tensor + 1 scalar = khronometric) left the **scalar (khronon) speed** open (KM-II §6: "may propagate at a different speed in principle"). The hyperbolic rule reduces this to one coefficient: writing the propagating perturbation as $ḧ_{ij} = c²∇²h_{ij} + ε·(trace)$, the khronon speed is $c_s/c = √(1+ε)$, with $ε$ a foliation-specific $λθ²$ kinetic term. $ε = 0$ → khronon at light speed; $ε ≠ 0$ → a second cone.

$ε$ is derived to be zero. The only candidate source of a $λθ²$ term is the commitment-reserve sector — and P11 makes that sector **one-way / dissipative** (monotone drain, no replenishment). A dissipative coupling enters the dispersion as the **imaginary** part of $ω$ (damping), never the **real** part (speed); a conservative $λθ²$ term shifts the real part. So P11 irreversibility makes the reserve **incapable** of being the kinetic term $ε ≠ 0$ requires. Simulation confirms the distinction is physical: a dissipative reserve term **damps and overdamps** the khronon without moving its cone (the speed is unshifted, the amplitude decays), in sharp contrast to the $ε$-knob, which cleanly shifts $c_s/c = √(1+ε)$. The forced rule (P05 transport + P11 drain) supplies no $λθ²$ term, and minimality forbids positing one.

> **$ε = 0$, $c_s = c$ — derived: ED's scalar gravitational-wave polarization is at the speed of light**, damped near active matter (overdamped where commitment fires) and clean in vacuum (observationally consistent — the far-field khronon is at $c$, undamped). This resolves KM-II §6 *as a derivation*, toward maximal predictivity — sharper than generic khronometric gravity, which allows $c_s ≠ c$. **This is the arrow's third hat** (the second being the mode count: the arrow breaks the time-gauge that would freeze the scalar, GR-II/R10).

A scalar gravitational-wave polarization *at $c$* is, in principle, **observationally distinguishable** from both pure General Relativity (two tensor modes, no scalar) and generic khronometric gravity (a scalar at $c_s ≠ c$) — a sharp, specific signature of ED's foliation sector.

**The three hats.** One primitive, P11, selects the Einstein/khronometric structure three independent times: **$α = 1$** at the lapse (the reserve cannot replenish — §4), the **khronon physical** at the mode count (the arrow breaks the time-gauge — GR-II), and the **khronon at light speed** (the reserve is dissipative, not kinetic — this section). The factor of two, the extra scalar, and that scalar's speed are one irreversibility wearing three hats. *The same arrow that makes the khronon keeps it on the light cone.*

---

## 7. The Engine, Built and Run

The rule is built and run (`evaluation/DynamicalBandwidth/`); results separated into *built-in* (the fixed point of the forced terms) and *emergent* (not built in).

### 7.1 The Newtonian field equation (fixed point)

The steady state satisfies $∇²b ∼ ρ$ ($corr(∇²b, ρ) = 0.999$, the bandwidth-Laplacian concentrated 52× on the source, harmonic vacuum). This confirms the two forced terms (P02 sharing + P11 sink) are Newtonian-consistent — the content being that they are primitive-grounded, not that Poisson is a surprise.

### 7.2 Schwarzschild mass-scaling $r_s ∝ M$ (emergent)

The deficit amplitude is **exactly linear** in the integrated source, in **both 2D and 3D** (3D: $r_s = 0.158, 0.316, 0.633$ for $M = 504, 1008, 2016$). $r_s ∝ M$ — the Schwarzschild relation. The raw 3D $1/r$ slope ($−1.68$) is finite-box/convergence-limited: **the mass-scaling is the invariant; the raw slope is not.**

### 7.3 The emergent horizon = a frozen A2 cut (the emergent result)

At strong coupling, $b → 0$ on a **finite-radius surface** ($g_{rr} ∼ 1/b → ∞$) — a metric horizon — where the reserve is exhausted, so the cut is **frozen** (P11). Nothing in the rule mentions a horizon; one forms. This realizes dynamically the identity that the $b → 0$ locus is *at once* an **A2 decoupling cut**, a **metric horizon**, and a **V5 surface** — one rule, one locus, three identities. **A2-dynamical is hereby realized by build-and-run, not argued.**

### 7.4 Area-law entropy $S ∝ A$ (emergent, holographic)

The severed-information count across the frozen cut (A1: capacity-zero across the cut → the hidden DOF are the boundary adjacency channels) scales as the horizon **perimeter** ($r_h^{0.96}$), **not** the enclosed bulk ($r_h^{2.01}$). The entropy is a **surface** quantity — holographic — on a horizon the rule formed dynamically. *(Half-structural: A1 severance is a surface cut. Half-measured: the emergent horizon is a clean compact surface — the part that could have failed and did not. The $1/4$ coefficient is value-inherited.)*

### 7.5 The mode count, from $F$ (derived)

The hyperbolic rule's gauge structure gives **2 tensor + 1 scalar** — the scalar physical because the arrow breaks the time-gauge — reproducing GR-II's khronometric count by direct operator analysis rather than the gauge-group argument. Tensor modes at $c$ (single P05 cone); scalar at $c$ (§6).

---

## 8. The Open Edge — One Number Open, One Corrected

Two quantities were carried as open in earlier drafts of this work; re-examination resolves one (the Hawking scaling — a measurement correction) and leaves one genuinely open ($α₁, α₂$). The paper states the open one as open rather than leaning on the structural pressure.

**$α₁, α₂$ (the preferred-frame front) — structurally suppressed, not computed.** ED is driven into the maximally-suppressed corner of the preferred-frame parameter space by **five independent derived mechanisms**: universal (not differential) Lorentz violation makes $α₁, α₂$ sub-leading (GR-II); $c_T = c$ and $c_s = c$ put both gravitational cones at light speed (the most-suppressed khronometric regime); the metric-only matter coupling removes the direct khronon–matter $α₁$ source (KM-I); and — ED-specific — the **dissipative near-field** (the overdamped khronon around matter, §6) cannot build the frame-dependent near-field response $α₁, α₂$ measure (P11, again). Five independent mechanisms point toward the same suppressed corner: strong pressure toward PPN-safety. **But the *values* are not computed here, and not faked** — they require the pinned couplings ($κ, D$) plus the khronometric PPN formulas, or a direct PPN expansion of $F$. The falsification front stays **formally open as a number**; what has changed is that the computation is now definite and foliation-knob-free.

**The Hawking temperature scaling $T ∝ 1/r_h$ — follows (derived; direct sim resolution-limited).** The emergent horizon carries both the area law ($S ∝ A$, §7) and the Hawking scaling. The surface gravity, given GR-I's Schwarzschild relation $g₀₀g_{rr} = −1$ (metric $−b\,dt² + b⁻¹dr²$), is $κ = ½∂_r b$ at the horizon; on the rule's *vacuum* solution $b = 1 − r_s/r$ (the linear rule is 3D-harmonic in vacuum) the horizon sits at $r = r_s$ and $κ = 1/(2r_s)$, so with $r_s ∝ M$ measured, **$κ ∝ 1/r_h$** — the Hawking relation. *(An earlier round reported this "flat" — a measurement error: it used $∂_r√b$, which **diverges** at the horizon since $√b = N → 0$; the corrected $κ = ½∂_r b$ is finite and scales. The minimal rule carries the Hawking scaling; no hyperbolic strong-field rule is required.)* The honest residual is that a **fully-direct** simulation of the near-horizon slope is resolution-limited — the elliptic relaxation smooths the $b = 0$ clip over a $D$-set width, capping the *measured* slope at the small horizons compact sources allow — so $κ ∝ 1/r_h$ is tiered as **derived** (rule vacuum solution + GR-I relation + measured $r_s ∝ M$), not as a clean direct measurement. The thermodynamic coefficient ($T = κ/2π$, $S = A/4$) stays value-inherited.

## 9. Position Relative to the Quartet

- **GR-I's two assumptions are closed.** $α = 1$ is forced (§4); the timelike geodesic identity is limit-forced (§5). GR-I's preamble items 6 and 9 are downgraded from postulate/assumption to derived/reduced, citing this paper.
- **GR-II's reduced object is built.** The field equation = steady state of $F$ (R9) is now an $F$ that exists and runs (§7); the mode count is reconfirmed from $F$ (§7); the field-equation form's Newtonian limit is measured.
- **KM-II §6 is resolved.** The scalar-mode speed, left open, is $c_s = c$ (§6, derived). KM-II's §6 caveat becomes "the khronon is at light speed, derived."
- **A2-dynamical (the working-program target #8) is realized.** The same rule that builds the EFE horizon forms A2's frozen cut — by build-and-run (§7).

What this paper does **not** change: the gravitational class (khronometric, GR-II); the MOND/cosmology sectors (KM-I/II); the value-inherited constants; and the one open number, $α₁, α₂$ (§8).

## 10. The Wedge — Empirical Content

1. **The khronon at light speed** — a falsifiable, sharp prediction: ED's scalar GW polarization propagates at $c$ (not a fast/slow second cone), damped near matter, clean in vacuum. A scalar polarization at $c$ is distinguishable in principle from pure-GR (two tensor modes only) and from generic khronometric gravity ($c_s ≠ c$).
2. **The emergent horizon's area law** — $S ∝ A$ on a dynamically-formed horizon; the holographic scaling is a structural prediction, the $1/4$ value-inherited.
3. **The preferred-frame numbers** — $α₁, α₂$, once computed (the definite, knob-free calculation §8 sets up), are the GR-II falsification front; this paper sharpens the lean and defines the computation, it does not pre-empt the verdict.
4. **Not claimed as wedges:** the $α₁, α₂$ values; the Hawking $T$ *coefficient* (the scaling is derived; the $T = κ/2π$ normalization is value-inherited); the strong-field metric; the full EFE.

## 11. Falsification Criteria

GR-III is falsifiable at every closed step and at each open number: break the lapse fork, the geodesic reduction, the khronon-speed derivation, or the field-equation/horizon build, and the corresponding result fails; the preferred-frame front closes for or against the theory once its numbers are computed. The sharpest, stated individually:

### 11.1 The lapse fork

**Falsifier sentence:** *A demonstration that the P04 commitment-reserve band co-scales with the internal band ($β ≠ 0$) — e.g. a replenishment channel slaving the reserve to $b_{int}$ — would reopen $α ≠ 1$ and the Einstein/Nordström fork, falsifying §4.*

### 11.2 The geodesic reduction

**Falsifier sentence:** *An explicit Σ-rule computation showing the massive-front coherence functional is **not** the Jacobi `J(b)` (i.e. the massive worldlines are not timelike geodesics of $g ∼ b⁻¹$) would falsify §5 — the limit checks (Fermat, Maupertuis) being necessary but not sufficient.*

### 11.3 The khronon speed

**Falsifier sentence:** *A demonstration that ED's foliation/reserve sector supplies a conservative $λθ²$ term ($ε ≠ 0$) — i.e. that the reserve coupling is kinetic, not dissipative — would falsify $c_s = c$ (§6) and give the khronon a second cone.*

### 11.4 The field equation / horizon

**Falsifier sentence:** *A demonstration that the forced rule's steady state is **not** $∇²b ∼ ρ$, or that strong coupling does **not** form a finite-radius $b → 0$ horizon / the severed entropy scales as the bulk ($r_h²$) not the surface ($r_h$), would falsify §7.*

### 11.5 The preferred-frame front (resolved in GR-IV)

**Falsifier sentence:** *A measured $α₁$ above the lunar-laser-ranging bound ($~10⁻⁴$), or **any** nonzero $α₂$ (GR-IV derives $α₂ = 0$ exactly from the two luminal cones $c_T = c$, $c_s = c$), would falsify ED-gravity-as-viable.* This paper's role on the front was to build the rule and derive the $c_s = c$ that GR-IV's PPN reduction consumes; GR-IV then closes the front favorably — $α₂ = 0$ structurally, $α₁ = −4λ_{local} ≲ 4×10⁻⁹³$ — so what GR-III left open by design is now closed.

---

## 12. Position Statement

**The dynamical rule Event-Density gravity reduces to is built and runs; its two weak-field assumptions are closed; its scalar mode is pinned to the light cone — and one irreversibility does all three structural jobs.** $α = 1$ is forced from the P04 band law (the reserve cannot replenish to track the metric band — Nordström excluded); the timelike geodesic identity is reduced to the massive eikonal of GR-I's proven null result; and the khronon propagates at $c$ because the reserve sector is dissipative, not kinetic (KM-II §6 resolved). The rule, built, has the Newtonian field equation as its fixed point, the Schwarzschild relation $r_s ∝ M$ (2D and 3D), an emergent finite-radius horizon that is a frozen A2 cut carrying area-law entropy, and the khronometric mode count read off $F$. The same primitive — the arrow, P11 — selects the Einstein branch at the lapse, makes the khronon physical at the mode count, and keeps it on the light cone.

**What this paper claims.** The dynamical rule is built and Newtonian-consistent; $α = 1$ is forced (Nordström excluded); the timelike geodesic identity is limit-forced; $c_s = c$ is derived; the emergent horizon, frozen A2 cut, and area law are measured; the mode count is from $F$; and the arrow's three structural selections are one unification.

**What this paper does not claim.** The full EFE is not derived; the class is khronometric, not pure GR; $α = 1$ rests on a band-accounting premise; the geodesic identity is reduced, not proven; $c_s = c$ is leading-order; the rule's coefficients are unpinned; **$α₁, α₂$ are not computed *in this paper*** (GR-IV computes them: $α₂ = 0$ exactly, $α₁$ safe by ≥70 orders); the Hawking scaling is **derived** ($κ = 1/(2r_s) ∝ 1/r_h$) but its **direct** simulation is resolution-limited and its coefficient value-inherited; and Einstein is not derived.

**Series context.** Paper GR-III of the post-pivot curvature-emergence line — the engine of the quartet (GR-I, GR-II, KM-I, KM-II): the rule they reduce to, built; the assumptions they carried, closed; the scalar speed they left open, derived. The preferred-frame numbers ($α₁, α₂$) it set up are resolved in GR-IV — $α₂ = 0$ exactly, $α₁$ safe by ≥70 orders.

### Glossary

- **The dynamical rule $F$.** $ḃ = F(ρ,∇ρ,b)$ — the bandwidth evolution whose steady state is the field equation (GR-II/R9); minimal forced form $ḃ = D∇²b − κρ$.
- **The three hats (of the arrow).** P11 selecting the Einstein/khronometric structure three times: $α=1$ (lapse), khronon physical (mode count), khronon at $c$ (scalar speed).
- **$α = 1$ / P-Commitment-Linear.** The lapse exponent, forced by the reserve's inability to replenish (P11); Nordström excluded.
- **Jacobi functional.** $J(b) = b⁻¹√(E²−m²b)$ — the timelike-geodesic functional; limit-forced to Fermat ($m→0$) and Maupertuis (weak field).
- **$ε$ / $c_s = c$.** The foliation-kinetic knob ($c_s/c = √(1+ε)$); derived zero (dissipative reserve), so the khronon is at light speed.
- **Frozen A2 cut.** The emergent $b→0$ horizon: a metric horizon, an A2 decoupling cut, and a V5 surface — one locus.
- **Area law $S ∝ A$.** The severed-channel count (A1) scaling as the horizon perimeter, not the bulk — holographic; coefficient value-inherited.

**End of Paper GR-III.**

*Post-pivot curvature-emergence line, the engine of the quartet. The dynamical rule ED's gravity reduces to is built and runs (Newtonian field equation as its fixed point; Schwarzschild $r_s∝M$ in 2D and 3D; an emergent finite-radius horizon that is a frozen A2 cut carrying area-law entropy $S∝A$ and the Hawking scaling $κ=1/(2r_s)∝1/r_h$; the khronometric mode count read off $F$). Its two weak-field assumptions are closed: $α=1$ forced from the P04 band law (Nordström excluded), the timelike geodesic identity limit-forced to GR-I's proven null result. Its scalar mode is pinned to the light cone ($c_s=c$, derived — the reserve is dissipative, not kinetic; KM-II §6 resolved). One irreversibility (P11) does all three structural jobs — the lapse, the mode count, the scalar speed. One number stays open and is flagged: $α₁,α₂$ (structurally suppressed, not computed, not faked); the Hawking scaling, earlier thought open, is corrected to a derived result (the direct sim measurement remains resolution-limited). No new primitives; Einstein not derived; the engine exists.*
