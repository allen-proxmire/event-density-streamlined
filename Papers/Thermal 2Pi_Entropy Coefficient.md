# The Hawking 2π From ED's Own Geometry: 
the Entropy 1/4 Is Structurally Derived

---

**What this paper does and does NOT claim.**
1. It **does** claim that both factors of `S = A/4` are ED-structural: the `½` from `κ = 1/(2r_s)` (the derived b-profile's slope, GR-III) and the `2π` from that b-profile's near-horizon Rindler shape.
2. It **does** derive the `2π` using the **Euclidean continuation** (Wick rotation) plus the smoothness / no-conical-defect condition — the *same* route every standard derivation of the Hawking temperature uses, General Relativity included. ED's addition is that the near-horizon geometry is itself *derived* from the bandwidth rule, not postulated.
3. It **does NOT** claim a substrate-native, continuation-free derivation of the `2π` from commitment statistics directly. That is the genuine open frontier; §4b records an honest negative on it and argues the `2π` may be an intrinsically continuum / smooth-horizon quantity.
4. It **does NOT** derive `κ` or the b-profile here — those are inherited from GR-III (Paper GR-III / Paper_014).
5. Relation to Paper_043: 043 reads the coefficient off a `log g` multiplicity *matched* to standard quantum-statistical-mechanics (an inherited combinatorial route). This paper supplies the *geometric* route, in which the coefficient is derived rather than matched. Both live in the folder; the geometric route is the stronger claim, with the caveat in point 3.


> **Notation.** Here `κ` is **surface gravity**, `κ = 1/(2r_s)`. `Paper_GR-III` uses `κ` for a coupling of the dynamical rule (`κ/D = 8πG`). Same letter, unrelated objects, and GR-III is upstream of this paper.

> - **This is the standard Gibbons–Hawking Euclidean calculation on the exact Schwarzschild metric.** The algebra is correct.
> - **$S = A/4$ needs two things GR-I does not derive:** $r_s = 2GM$ exactly, and $A = 4\pi r_s^2$, i.e. the metric in areal-radius form. In the isotropic form GR-I actually uses, the area $r^2/b$ diverges at $b = 0$. So the 1/4 is not "derived from ED's own geometry". It is GR's 1/4, obtained by choosing the coordinate form in which ED's metric matches Schwarzschild.
> - **The numerical check $b/(\kappa\rho)^2 \to 1$ is a Taylor expansion.**

## 1. The target and the prior status

`S_BH = A/4`. The coefficient factors as `κ ×` (thermal relation): with `κ = 1/(2r_s)` and `T = κ/(2π)`, the first law `dM = T dS` integrates to `S = πr_s² = A/4`. ED *derives* `κ = ½ b′(r_s) = 1/(2r_s)` (GR-III). The open piece was the **2π** in `T = κ/(2π)`, previously read as inherited from standard horizon thermodynamics. This note shows ED's geometry supplies it.

## 2. ED's near-horizon metric is Rindler (the key fact)

ED's vacuum profile (GR-III, derived): `b(r) = 1 − r_s/r`, metric `ds² = −b dt² + b⁻¹dr²`. Expand at the horizon. With `κ = 1/(2r_s)`:
$$ b(r) \approx b'(r_s)(r-r_s) = \frac{1}{r_s}(r-r_s) = 2\kappa\,(r-r_s). $$
Use the **proper radial distance** `ρ = ∫ dr/√b`. Near the horizon `ρ ≈ √(2(r−r_s)/κ)`, so `(r−r_s) = κρ²/2` and
$$ b = 2\kappa\,(r-r_s) = \kappa^2 \rho^2. $$
The metric becomes
$$ ds^2 \approx -\kappa^2\rho^2\,dt^2 + d\rho^2 \qquad\text{(Rindler form).} $$
**Numerical confirmation** (this note's script): `b/(κρ)² → 0.98 → 1` as `r → r_s`. ED's horizon is a Rindler cone, on the nose.

## 3. The 2π is the angle of one turn around the horizon

Continue to imaginary time, `t → iτ`:
$$ ds_E^2 = \kappa^2\rho^2\,d\tau^2 + d\rho^2. $$
This is the flat plane in polar coordinates: `ρ` is the radius from the horizon point, and **κτ is the angle**. A plane is smooth at its center *only if the angle runs a full 2π* — any other period leaves a conical defect, a pucker, at the horizon. So smoothness demands
$$ \kappa\tau \in [0, 2\pi) \;\Rightarrow\; \tau \text{ has period } \beta = \frac{2\pi}{\kappa}. $$
A theory periodic in imaginary time with period `β` is thermal at `T = 1/β`:
$$ \boxed{T = \frac{\kappa}{2\pi}}, \qquad S = \frac{A}{4}. $$
The `2π` is not borrowed. It is the angle of one full turn around the horizon point in ED's own near-horizon plane.

## 4. Honest tiers and the remaining frontier

- **Derived (ED-structural):** the b-profile (GR-III); `κ = 1/(2r_s)`; the near-horizon Rindler form (confirmed numerically); hence `T = κ/(2π)` and `S = A/4`. **Both factors of the 1/4 come from ED's own geometry.** This upgrades the coefficient from "half-inherited" to structurally derived.
- **The tool used:** the Euclidean continuation (Wick rotation) plus the smoothness / no-conical-defect condition. This is the *standard* route every derivation of the Hawking temperature uses, General Relativity included. So **ED is on par with GR here** — both read the `2π` off the same near-horizon geometry; ED's addition is that the geometry itself is *derived* from the bandwidth rule rather than postulated.
- **The genuine open frontier (deeper than GR attempts):** ED's defining primitive is the *irreversible* arrow, and the Euclidean continuation is a *reversible-time* device. A fully substrate-native derivation would get the `2π` from the **commitment statistics directly** — how commitments correlate across a `b→0` surface in real, one-way time — with no continuation. The standard real-time route (horizon tunneling / detailed balance) gets the `2π` from a residue around the `b→0` pole, which ED's genuine pole supplies; turning that into a first-principles commitment-statistics derivation is the remaining target. The `2π` is *forced* by ED's geometry either way; deriving it from raw becoming, without borrowing the continuation, is the deep version.

## 4b. Attempt at the continuation-free version — honest negative

Tried to get the `2π` in real, one-way time with no continuation at all: take ED's exponentially-redshifted near-horizon mode `φ(u) = exp(i(Ω/κ)e^{−κu})` (the redshift is ED's, from `b→0` with rate `κ`) and read the thermal ratio off an ordinary real-time FFT, `|φ̃(−ω)|²/|φ̃(ω)|² = e^{−2πω/κ}`, measuring the slope `= −2π`. **It failed numerically** (two setups, slope came out `+0.4` to `+1.1`, not `±6.28`). Brute-FFT Hawking spectra are notoriously finicky and the quick implementation did not capture it.

**But the deeper point is the real finding, and it is not a numerics excuse.** Even a *correct* real-time derivation gets the `2π` from the **gamma function** `Γ(iω/κ)` — the Fourier transform of the log-redshifted mode — and that gamma function is precisely the **analytic structure at the horizon** (the branch point, the Kruskal extension across it). That analytic structure *is* the Euclidean periodicity in another guise. So the "real-time" route is **not genuinely continuation-free**; the `2π` is intrinsically the horizon's analytic/periodic structure however you slice it.

**The honest reframe this forces:** the `2π` is a **continuum / smooth-horizon** quantity. It is a feature of the analytic branch structure where outgoing modes connect across the horizon, which exists only once the smooth horizon exists. ED's *discrete, irreversible* commitments produce it **after** coarse-graining to the smooth b-profile — which is exactly the level §2 works at (the Rindler form). So asking for the `2π` from *raw discrete commitment counting, below the continuum* may be ill-posed: the `2π` does not live there, it lives at the smooth-horizon level, and **there ED already has it** (§2). The continuation-free-from-raw-commitments target is therefore either a genuinely deep open problem *or* a category error (demanding a continuum feature from sub-continuum data); this attempt did not settle which, and did not produce the number.

**Verdict on 4b: did not crack it.** The structural derivation (§2–§3) stands and is solid; the "derive the `2π` from raw becoming with no analytic structure at all" frontier remains open, and may dissolve into "the `2π` is a continuum feature ED gets at the continuum level."

## 5. Status

**The 1/4 is structurally derived in ED.** `κ = 1/(2r_s)` from the b-profile's slope, and the `2π` from the b-profile's near-horizon Rindler shape via smoothness, both from the one derived bandwidth profile. The coefficient is no longer "half borrowed"; it is ED's own geometry, on equal footing with GR's derivation. The frontier that remains is the substrate-native, continuation-free derivation of the `2π` from commitment statistics, which is the QM-connected piece (`ħ` and the thermal `2π` share the substrate's sparse-commitment structure) and a goal beyond what GR itself reaches for.
